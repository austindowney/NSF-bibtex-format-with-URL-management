<\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}> must be used for the make links hyperlinks


The following changes have been made:

1. Hyperlinks to titles in articles
1. URL links are provided
1. If URL is empty and a DOI is provided, a link is generated from the DOI.
1. If URL is empty and no DOI is provided, it ends the citation with a "."


Still want to do:
1. Add hyperlinks to all titles.
1. Convert titles to title case.
