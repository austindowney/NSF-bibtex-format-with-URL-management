	\section{Custom bibtex format}		

	This is designed to work with Jabref where if you use the auto bibtex generator for a DOI and the arXiv number. However, if there is a URL defined by the bibtex entry this supersedes the auto-generated URL. Also, this bst file does not use full names as you can not always get full names on papers and it looks odd to only have some with full names. All URL are linked, as it the title in the article format, but this should be removed. 
	
	
	You must use <\textbackslash usepackage[hidelinks]\{hyperref\}> must be used for the make links hyperlinks
	
	Underscores ``\_'' in the DOI entry will break the bibtex compile, you must insert a backslash (e.g., \textbackslash \_) by hand in the .bib file. 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Here are some examples \cite{test1,test2,test3,test4,test5,test6,test7,test8,test9}.	
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Note that jabref leaves the year blank for a arXiv number. 
	\item The major changes in the .bst file are on line 1923.
	\end{itemize}
